# Predicting House Prices based on various variables

## Summary
This is a project to predict house prices based on various variables such as Size, Number of Bedrooms / Bathrooms, Parking Spaces etc.\
A future aim of this prediction would be to compare the prediction to house sale websites and identify houses that are considered a bargain.

## The Results
In it's current form, the model can predict house prices, however isn't as accurate as I would like.\
I believe that this is due to the model not being provided enough data during the training stage. \
This is a limitation of the original dataset only containing around 500 houses. Which upon reflection is not enough data to create an accurate model.
